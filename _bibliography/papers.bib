	abstract = {The electronic and vibrational properties of 2D materials are dramatically altered by the formation of a moiré superlattice. The lowest-energy phonon modes of the superlattice are two acoustic branches (called phasons) that describe the sliding motion of one layer with respect to the other. Considering their low-energy dispersion and damping, these modes may act as a significant source of scattering for electrons in moiré materials. Here, we investigate temperature-dependent electrical transport in minimally twisted bilayer graphene, a moiré system developing multiple weakly-dispersive electronic bands and a reconstructed lattice structure. We measure a linear-in-temperature resistivity across the band manyfold above \$T{\textbackslash}sim\{10\}\$ K, preceded by a quadratic temperature dependence. While the linear-in-temperature resistivity is up to two orders of magnitude larger than in monolayer graphene, it is reduced (approximately by a factor of three) with respect to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Moreover, it is modulated by the recursive band filling, with minima located close to the full filling of each band. Comparing our results with a semiclassical transport calculation, we show that the experimental trends are compatible with scattering processes mediated by longitudinal phasons, which dominate the resistivity over the contribution from conventional acoustic phonons of the monolayer. Our findings highlight the close relation between vibrational modes unique to moiré materials and carrier transport therein.},

	abstract = {Atomically thin materials offer multiple opportunities for layer-by-layer control of their electronic properties. While monolayer graphene (MLG) is a zero-gap system, Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) acquires a finite band gap when the symmetry between the layers’ potential energy is broken, usually, via a displacement electric field applied in double-gate devices. Here, we introduce a twistronic stack comprising both MLG and BLG, synthesized via chemical vapor deposition, showing a Bernal gap in the absence of external fields. Although a large ({\textasciitilde}30°) twist angle decouples the MLG and BLG electronic bands near Fermi level, proximity-induced energy shifts in the outermost layers result in a built-in asymmetry, which requires a displacement field of 0.14 V/nm to be compensated. The latter corresponds to a {\textasciitilde}10 meV intrinsic BLG gap, a value confirmed by our thermal-activation measurements. The present results highlight the role of structural asymmetry and encapsulating environment, expanding the engineering toolbox for monolithically-grown graphene multilayers.},

	abstract = {The growth of high-quality graphene on flat and rigid templates, such as metal thin films on insulating wafers, is regarded as a key enabler for technologies based on 2D materials. In this work, the growth of decoupled graphene is introduced via non-reducing low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire. The resulting film is atomically flat, with no detectable cracks or ripples, and lies atop of a thin Cu2O layer, as confirmed by microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy analyses. Post-growth treatment of the partially decoupled graphene enables full and uniform oxidation of the interface, greatly simplifying subsequent transfer processes, particularly dry-pick up — a task that proves challenging when dealing with graphene directly synthesized on metallic Cu(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal high carrier mobility at room temperature, exceeding 104 cm2 V−1 s−1 on SiO2/Si and 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The demonstrated growth approach yields exceptional material quality, in line with micro-mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes, and thus paves the way toward large-scale production of pristine graphene suitable for high-performance next-generation applications.},

	abstract = {The assembly of supramolecular structures within living systems is an innovative approach for introducing artificial constructs and developing biomaterials capable of influencing and/or regulating the biological responses of living organisms. By integrating chemical, photophysical, morphological, and structural characterizations, it is shown that the cell-driven assembly of 2,6-diphenyl-3,5-dimethyl-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene-4,4-dioxide (DTTO) molecules into fibers results in the formation of a “biologically assisted” polymorphic form, hence the term bio-polymorph. Indeed, X-ray diffraction reveals that cell-grown DTTO fibers present a unique molecular packing leading to specific morphological, optical, and electrical properties. Monitoring the process of fiber formation in cells with time-resolved photoluminescence, it is established that cellular machinery is necessary for fiber production and a non-classical nucleation mechanism for their growth is postulated. These biomaterials may have disruptive applications in the stimulation and sense of living cells, but more crucially, the study of their genesis and properties broadens the understanding of life beyond the native components of cells.},

Their complexity and the multiscale nature yield a wide variety of electrical characteristics ranging from doped semiconductor to glassy metals depending on the crystalline quality of the nanosheets, their specific structural organization ant the operating temperature. Here, the charge transport (CT) mechanisms are studied that are occurring in GRM thin films near the metal-insulator transition (MIT) highlighting the role of defect density and local arrangement of the nanosheets. Two prototypical nanosheet types are compared, i.e., 2D reduced graphene oxide and few-layer-thick electrochemically exfoliated graphene flakes, forming thin films with comparable composition, morphology and room temperature conductivity, but different defect density and crystallinity. By investigating their structure, morphology, and the dependence of their electrical conductivity on temperature, noise and magnetic-field, a general model is developed describing the multiscale nature of CT in GRM thin films in terms of hopping among mesoscopic bricks, i.e., grains. The results suggest a general approach to describe disordered van der Waals thin films.},

	abstract = {Graphene nanosheets have outstanding adsorption efficiency toward organic molecules but the potential as sorbent for water purification is strongly limited by the tedious recovery of the nanosheets after the treatment, which can cause secondary contaminations. Here, we demonstrate that graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO (rGO) nanosheets aggregation in tap water, enabling their separation by dead-end microfiltration (MF) on commercial polymeric hollow fiber modules. No evidence of GO/rGO contamination was found in microfiltered water and chemical potability of treated water was confirmed by standard protocols. Moreover, GO/rGO can be recovered (by inverting the filtration modality from IN-OUT to OUT-IN), washed and reused, this allowing the regeneration and reuse of both graphene nanosheets and the filtration module. The procedure (called here GO + MF) was optimized on tap water spiked with ofloxacin (OFLOX) or methylene blue (MB), as reference. The optimized procedure was then applied both with GO and rGO to the removal of a mixture of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from tap water at μg/L levels, the highest concentration found in water resources abstracted for water consumption. We demonstrate that rGO + MF procedure allows to remove 138 μg/g of total PFASs in only 30 min, i.e. an efficiency 3–5 times higher than granular activated carbon (43 μg/g) used in real potabilization plants for PFASs removal.},

	abstract = {Light absorption and charge transport in oxide semiconductors can be tuned by the introduction, during deposition, of a small quantity of foreign elements, leading to the improvement of the photoelectrocatalytic performance. In this work, both unmodified and vanadium-modified TiO2 thin films deposited by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering are investigated as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Following a structural characterization by X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoelectrocatalysis is discussed based on ultrafast transient absorbance spectroscopy measurements. In particular, three different pump wavelengths from UV to the visible range are used (300, 390, and 530 nm) in order to cover the relevant photoactive spectral range of modified TiO2. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra show that incorporation of vanadium in TiO2 extends water splitting in the visible range up to ≈530 nm, a significant improvement compared to unmodified TiO2 that is active only in the UV range ≲390  nm. However, transient absorbance spectroscopy clearly reveals that vanadium accelerates electron–hole recombination upon UV irradiation, resulting in a lower photon-to-current conversion efficiency in the UV spectral range with respect to unmodified TiO2. The new photoelectrocatalytic activity in the visible range is attributed to a V-induced introduction of intragap levels at ≈2.2 eV below the bottom of the conduction band. This is confirmed by long-living transient signals due to electrons photoexcited into the conduction band after visible light (530 nm) pulses. The remaining holes migrate to the semiconductor–electrolyte interface where they are captured by long-lived traps and eventually promote water oxidation under visible light.},

	abstract = {There are tens of industrial producers claiming to sell graphene and related materials (GRM), mostly as solid powders. Recently the quality of commercial GRM has been questioned, and procedures for GRM quality control were suggested using Raman Spectroscopy or Atomic Force Microscopy. Such techniques require dissolving the sample in solvents, possibly introducing artefacts. A more pragmatic approach is needed, based on fast measurements and not requiring any assumption on GRM solubility. To this aim, we report here an overview of the properties of commercial GRM produced by selected companies in Europe, USA and Asia. We benchmark: (A) size, (B) exfoliation grade and (C) oxidation grade of each GRM versus the ones of ‘ideal’ graphene and, most importantly, versus what reported by the producer. In contrast to previous works, we report explicitly the names of the GRM producers and we do not re-dissolve the GRM in solvents, but only use techniques compatible with industrial powder metrology. A general common trend is observed: products having low defectivity (\%sp2 bonds {\textgreater}95\%) feature low surface area ({\textless}200 m2 g−1), while highly exfoliated GRM show a lower sp2 content, demonstrating that it is still challenging to exfoliate GRM at industrial level without adding defects.},

The multiscale structure and the two-dimensional (2D) nature of the building block mean that interfaces naturally play a crucial role in the charge transport of such thin films. While single or few stacked nanosheets (i.e., vdW heterostructures) have been the subject of intensive works, little is known about how charges travel through multilayered, more disordered networks. Here, we report a comprehensive study of a prototypical system given by networks of randomly stacked reduced graphene oxide 2D nanosheets, whose chemical and geometrical properties can be controlled independently, permitting to explore percolated networks ranging from a single nanosheet to some billions with room-temperature resistivity spanning from 10–5 to 10–1 Ω·m. We systematically observe a clear transition between two different regimes at a critical temperature T*: Efros–Shklovskii variable-range hopping (ES-VRH) below T* and power law behavior above. First, we demonstrate that the two regimes are strongly correlated with each other, both depending on the charge localization length ξ, calculated by the ES-VRH model, which corresponds to the characteristic size of overlapping sp2 domains belonging to different nanosheets. Thus, we propose a microscopic model describing the charge transport as a geometrical phase transition, given by the metal–insulator transition associated with the percolation of quasi-one-dimensional nanofillers with length ξ, showing that the charge transport behavior of the networks is valid for all geometries and defects of the nanosheets, ultimately suggesting a generalized description on vdW and disordered thin films.},
