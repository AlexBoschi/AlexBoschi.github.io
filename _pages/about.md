I currently integrate scalable, grown graphene crystals into optoelectronic devices aimed at next‑generation telecommunications applications.

I have experience in device microfabrication, thin‑film deposition through wet‑chemistry methods, and the physical characterization of these systems.

My research interests include the experimental investigation of novel phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures based on two‑dimensional materials, as well as the surface properties of molecular assemblies at the nanoscale and in thin films.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
